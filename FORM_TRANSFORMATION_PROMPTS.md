# Quick Prompt Template for Form-to-Page Transformation

## üéØ Use This Prompt for Any Form Component

```
Transform this [COMPONENT_NAME] from a floating modal/dialog to a full-page layout:

1. Remove modal overlay (fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50)
2. Change to full page (min-h-screen bg-gray-50)
3. Make header sticky with shadow (sticky top-0 shadow-sm z-10)
4. Center content with max-width (max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6)
5. Use X icon from lucide-react for close button
6. Remove rounded corners from main container
7. Keep only ESC key handler, remove click-outside handlers

Follow the pattern from VisitForm.tsx
```

## üìù Example Prompts

### For a specific file:
```
Transform all modal dialogs in src/pages/ApprovalsPage.tsx to full-page layouts 
following the pattern in FORM_TO_PAGE_TRANSFORMATION_GUIDE.md
```

### For multiple files:
```
Convert all Dialog components in the following files to full-page layouts:
- src/pages/ApprovalsPage.tsx
- src/pages/PRDetails.tsx

Use the FullPageDialog pattern from the transformation guide.
```

### For creating a reusable component:
```
Create a FullPageDialog component in src/components/ui/full-page-dialog.tsx 
that implements the full-page pattern with:
- Sticky header
- Close button (X icon)
- Centered content with configurable max-width
- ESC key handler
- Proper TypeScript types
```

### For reviewing existing components:
```
Search for all components using:
- "fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50"
- "Dialog" or "Modal" imports
- "max-w-" with "rounded-lg"

List them for full-page transformation.
```

## üîç Search Patterns

Use these to find components that need transformation:

### VS Code Search Regex:
```regex
(fixed inset-0.*bg-black.*bg-opacity)|(Dialog.*open=)|(Modal.*isOpen)
```

### Grep Search:
```bash
grep -r "fixed inset-0.*bg-black" src/
grep -r "DialogContent" src/
grep -r "max-w-.*rounded" src/
```
