## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "Target class [dompdf.wrapper] does not exist"
**Cause**: DomPDF package not installed
**Solution**: 
```bash
composer require barryvdh/laravel-dompdf
php artisan config:clear
```

### Issue: Arabic text appears as boxes (□□□)
**Cause**: Font doesn't support Arabic Unicode
**Solution**: 
- DejaVu Sans (default) supports Arabic
- Install Arabic package for better shaping:
```bash
composer require ab-alselwi/laravel-arabic-html
```

### Issue: PDF downloads but is blank
**Cause**: View cache or missing data
**Solution**:
```bash
php artisan view:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```
Check if database record exists.

### Issue: "Return receipt only available for returned requests"
**Cause**: Request status is not "returned"
**Solution**: This is expected behavior. Change request status to "returned" or use regular PDF instead.

### Issue: PDF layout broken or overlapping text
**Cause**: CSS conflicts or missing styles
**Solution**: Check PDF view file for proper HTML/CSS structure. Ensure no conflicting styles.

## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. Full Bilingual Support
Every single label and header appears in both Arabic and English, with Arabic taking primary position.

### 2. Professional Design
Color-coded sections, status badges, structured layouts, and signature areas create professional-looking documents.

### 3. Complete Data Display
All relevant information from database appears in PDFs: employee details, dates, equipment lists, quantities, conditions, approvals.

### 4. Conditional Arabic Processing
Controllers check if Arabic HTML package is available and use it if installed, ensuring PDFs work even without the package (with slightly less perfect Arabic text shaping).

### 5. Error Handling
Frontend displays detailed error messages with troubleshooting steps. Backend catches exceptions and returns helpful JSON responses.

### 6. RTL Support
Proper right-to-left text direction with correct alignment ensures Arabic text reads naturally.
